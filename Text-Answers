f. Created it manually, index.html is just a file I uploaded to "ory-bucket" that says "<h1>Hi</h1>"
g. To restrict access to that bucket for specific people I'd have to use AWS's IAM functionality. 
This is the procedure I would follow:
Open the IAM console.
From the console, open the IAM user or role that should have access to only a certain bucket.
In the Permissions tab of the IAM user or role, expand each policy to view its JSON policy document.
In the JSON policy documents, search for the policy that grants the user permission to the s3:ListAllMyBuckets action or to s3:* actions (all S3 actions).
Modify the policy to remove permission to the s3:ListAllMyBuckets action. (because I want him to have access only to the bucket, else I dont need to do this)
Then, add permission to s3:ListBucket only for the bucket or folder that I want the user to access from the console.

The following example policy is for access to a bucket. The policy allows the user to perform the s3:ListBucket, s3:PutObject, and s3:GetObject actions only on the static html file I created:
{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement":[
      {
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Action":[
            "s3:ListBucket"
         ],
         "Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::ory-bucket"
      },
      {
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Action":[
            "s3:PutObject",
            "s3:GetObject"
         ],
         "Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::ory-bucket/*"
      }
   ]
}
